NEToolKit
=========
A toolkit for NeuroEvolution featuring NEAT and rtNEAT (work in progress).

## Building on Linux

You can build with the provided `CMakeLists.txt` file.

For example:
```
$ cd /path/to/repo/
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

And you're good to go.

## Building on Windows

You can probably use the `CMakeLists.txt` file too, but I'm not yet sure it works perfectly on windows (more specifically for building the example project).

However, you can use the Visual Studio C++ 2017 project files.
